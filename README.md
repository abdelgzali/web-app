# Hoop Trade
*Client side web application built with Vue.js*

### NBA fantasy basketball trade recommendation engine
Search an active NBA players name, client returns 10 fantasy trade suggestions based on the **VALUE** metric. Player values are fetched from [fb-ninja](fb-ninja.com), essentially a metric for comparing a players std deviation from the mean in each category. The value metric also takes in category weight into account, and ranks all active NBA players accordingly.
